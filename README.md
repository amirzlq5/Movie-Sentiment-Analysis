# Movie-Sentiment-Analysis

Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie.  While providing a numerical/stars rating to a movie tellsus about the success orfailure of a movie quantitatively, a collection of movie reviews is what gives us a deeper qualitative insight on different aspects of themovie. A textual movie review tells us about the the strong and weak points of the movie and deeperanalysis of a movie review can tell us if the movie in general meets the expectations of the reviewer.
