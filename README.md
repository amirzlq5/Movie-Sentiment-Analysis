# Movie-Sentiment-Analysis  :blush: :worried:

Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie.  While providing a numerical/stars rating to a movie tellsus about the success orfailure of a movie quantitatively, a collection of movie reviews is what gives us a deeper qualitative insight on different aspects of themovie. A textual movie review tells us about the the strong and weak points of the movie and deeperanalysis of a movie review can tell us if the movie in general meets the expectations of the reviewer.

## The Dataset
The dataset that can be downloaded from this [ Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
If you download the dataset and extract the compressed file, you will see a CSV file. The file contains 50,000 records and two columns: review and sentiment.


## The Embeddings File
We use GloVe embeddings to create our feature matrix. The embeddings file that can be downloaded from this [ Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/terenceliu4444/glove6b100dtxt).


## Analysis Techniques in Movie-Sentiment 
We will use three different types of deep neural networks: Densely connected neural network (Basic Neural Network), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM), which is a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks. Furthermore, we will see how to evaluate deep learning model on a totally unseen data.
